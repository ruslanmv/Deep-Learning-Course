**Neural Networks with Keras**
====================================

Keras is a high-level neural networks API that provides an easy-to-use interface for building and training neural networks. It runs on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano, allowing users to switch between different backend engines seamlessly. In this blog post, we will introduce Keras and TensorFlow, get started with building neural networks, cover the fundamentals of machine learning, and work with Keras to build and train neural networks.

### 1. **Introduction to Keras and TensorFlow**

Keras is a Python library that provides a simple and intuitive way to build neural networks. It was developed by Fran√ßois Chollet, a Google engineer, and was later acquired by Google. Keras provides an easy-to-use interface for building neural networks, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced machine learning practitioners alike.

TensorFlow, on the other hand, is an open-source software library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited and fine-tuned for large-scale Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tasks. Its primary use is in developing and training artificial neural networks, particularly deep neural networks.

**Example Code:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create a simple neural network using Keras
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
### 2. **Getting Started with Neural Networks**

In this section, we will build a simple neural network using Kerao classifn digits.

**Example Code:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow impors
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the digits dataset
digits = load_digits()
X = digits.data
y = digits.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a neural network using Keras
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(64,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}')
```
### 3. **Fundamentals of Machine Learning**

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training models to make predictions or take actions based on data.

**Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the goal is to learn a mapping between input data and output labels.

**Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the goal is to discover patterns or structure in the data.

**Regression**

Regression involves predicting a continuous value, such as a price or a temperature.

**Classification**

Classification involves predicting a categorical label, such as a class or a category.

### 4. **Working with Keras**

In this section, we will work with Keras to build and train neural networks.

**Example Code:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a neural network using Keras
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}')
```
